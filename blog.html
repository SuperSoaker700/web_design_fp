                    <h2>Queensland Australia</h2>
                    <p><em>2/27/2025</em></p>
					<p>My latest journey took me to Queensland, Australia, a place of breathtaking landscapes, exotic wildlife, and vibrant cities. One of my first stops was a wildlife reserve, where I got up close with some of Australia’s most iconic animals. Kangaroos lounged in the open fields, barely acknowledging my presence, while koalas clung lazily to eucalyptus trees. I even saw a cassowary, a massive prehistoric-looking bird that looked like it belonged in another era. It was amazing to see these creatures thriving in their natural habitat. Exploring further into nature, I wandered along a peaceful creek, soaking in the sounds of the wild. As I got closer to the water, something bright caught my eye—a vivid green snake slithering effortlessly up a tree. It moved so fluidly, completely blending into the leaves. I stood still, watching it, feeling like I had stepped into a world far removed from civilization. Queensland’s beaches were just as stunning, though they came with an unexpected challenge. As I walked along the sand, waves crashing at my feet, I noticed tiny bluebottle jellyfish scattered everywhere. Their translucent bodies glistened under the sun, a beautiful yet dangerous sight. I carefully watched my step, but the locals walked barefoot without a care. Maybe they had just learned how to avoid them, but I wasn’t about to take the risk. When night fell, Brisbane became a whole new world. The city lights reflected off the river, and the streets buzzed with energy. Looking up, I saw massive dark shapes gliding overhead. At first, I thought they were birds, but then I realized they were giant fruit bats. Their enormous wingspans made them look like something from a gothic fairytale. It was mesmerizing to watch them soaring between the buildings, completely at home in the urban night sky. Later that night, I had one of the most unexpected encounters. While walking through the city, I spotted a possum perched on a railing, completely unfazed by the people passing by. Unlike the possums back home, this one wasn’t skittish at all. When I reached out my hand, it hesitated for just a moment before letting me pet it. Its fur was softer than I expected, and its big curious eyes studied me just as much as I studied it. Queensland was the perfect mix of adventure and discovery. From spotting wild snakes in the trees to walking among giant bats in the city, every moment felt like something out of a nature documentary. I can’t wait to return and see what other hidden wonders Australia has in store.</p>

                    <h2>Engaged in New Zealand</h2>
                    <p><em>February 13, 2025</em></p>
					<p>This is my first post to my Travel Blog, where I will be documenting my adventures around the world, the places I go, the people I meet, and the experiences I have. My latest excursion was to New Zealand where I traveled to Waiheke Island to visit a friend. Waiheke is a subtropical Island off of Auckland in the North Island of NZ, and it's absolutely stunning! The sea water has a unique turquoise color, which gave the surrounding plantation and the rest of the Island a turquoise look. The terrain was harsh with rough hills, dense forests, and bendy, narrow roads. A few times when we drove the harsh roads I thought we were going to crash. Near the edges of the Island has smooth grassy hills that are dotted with rocks and boulders and has many sheep. Around the beaches you can find shopping streets and restaurants where tourists visit, but me, my friend, and her family enjoyed spending time at the more quiet secluded beaches. Inland are the towns where residents buy everyday goods, where my friend and her family buy their essentials. They live in a large house that oversees all four corners of the Island, where they have the most beautiful view of the ocean from their porch, and far off you can see Auckland on the mainland, which looks especially cool with the lights at night. Me and my friend spent a lot of time on that porch, and it was the perfect place to propose to her. At the age of 19 we were engaged. With someone else to care for, to know, to love, I never traveled alone from that point on.</p>
